# Knowledge Graph Index

This is the entry point to your knowledge graph - a collection of topic notes that persist across sessions.

## How It Works

1. **Create topic notes** - When something deserves its own page, create `kg/topic-name.md`
2. **Link between notes** - Use `[[topic-name]]` to link related topics
3. **Keep this index updated** - Add links here so you can find things

## Structure

Organize however makes sense. Some ideas:

### Projects
- [[project-name]] - Description

### Topics
- [[topic-name]] - What it covers

### References
- [[reference-name]] - Useful information

## Getting Started

When you learn something worth remembering:
1. Is it a one-off fact? → Put it in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Is it a lasting topic? → Create a note in `kg/`
3. Link it from here so you can find it
